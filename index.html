									<h2>Hello! I'm Venkat</h2>
								</header>
								<p><b>MS Computer Science (Aug 2023 - May 2025) - </b> <i>Arizona State University, USA</i><br />
									GPA - 4.22/4 <br />
									<b>BS Computer Science (Aug 2014 - May 2018) - </b> - <i>Madras Institute of Technology, India</i> <br />
									GPA - 3.51/4 </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/venkat.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After graduating with my Bachelor's, I started my career as a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.genesys.com/en-gb" target="_blank"><b>Genesys</b></a> in the Voice Platform IVR development team. The services owned by our team was the central most important components of the entire production setup as IVR is the first customer facing part of any contact center. Being a part of this team gave me the opportunity to develop and deliver several high-impact features right from the beginning of my career.</p>
								<p>The consistent high quality of my deliverables convinced my management to give me ownership of the Reporting Server (<i>a Java-based billing and reporting service</i>) at a very early stage in my career. It is a very crucial product as it collects the billing data from all other services in the Voice Platform which would be used to generate billing reports and bill customers. This further propelled my technical expertise to various degrees as I took up the complete responsibility of conceiving and developing new features in the product, to delivering iteration releases and to handling customer escalations
								independently.</p>
								<p>I am grateful to have had the opportunity of working with a wide range of tech stack. Below is my skill set -<br />
								<ul>
									<li><b>Programming:</b> C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, ReactJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, Python, Perl and Golang.<br /></li>
									<li><b>Technologies:</b> AWS, GCP, Azure, REST APIs, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Kafka, github-actions, Terraform, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana, Zabbix, Ansible, Chef, Puppet and Selenium. <br /></li>
									<li><b>Databases:</b> MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.</li>
									<li><b>Operational skills:</b> Time management, Collaboration, Leadership (mentored several junior resources in our team), On-call experience (handling critical production issues/incidents), and plenty of experience working directly with on-premise customers to resolve critical production issues/incidents.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>After an enlightening 5 years at Genesys, I decided it was time to expand my horizons both professionally and personally. What better way to achieve this than by pursuing a Master's degree in a global setting?
								I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University, maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA. I am on track to graduate Summa Cum Laude by May 2025.</p>
								<p>Please do check out my <a href="#footer"><b>resumes</b></a> below. With professional work experience across Full-Stack Software Development, Cloud Development, DevOps, and SRE, I have crafted two variants of my resume to ensure that each highlights my relevant skills and experiences tailored to specific roles. Whether you're looking for expertise in end-to-end software development or cloud infrastructure management, you'll find a resume that showcases my experience and expertise in that area.</p>
