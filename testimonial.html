									<h1>Words from my Supervisors</h1>
								</header>

									<h2>Manivannan Periasamy</h2>
									<p><b>Senior Manager, Development, Genesys</b></p>
									<blockquote>Venkat joined Genesys as a fresher and his recruitment into the Development team was done based on his excellent academic record and extraordinary performance during the coding assessments and interview
										sessions. The commitment he displayed and his performance as a fresher were phenomenal. His first major achievement was to successfully complete the cloud application security review for the Reporting Server product which was highly critical. It was an extremely challenging and lengthy process as it involved a huge number of subtasks. He single handedly worked and completed all the tasks to ensure the security of the product. His hard work and diligence in this task convinced me to give him
										ownership of the component thereby making him our youngest Developer to become a Component Owner. Apart from his meticulous working style, I have constantly noted and would like to point out Venkat's sincerity toward any responsibility he takes up. Clear and concise communication, eagerness to take up new challenges, technical expertise, and the thirst to innovate are some promising qualities that I see in him, which I undoubtedly believe would propel him to greater heights as an Engineer.</blockquote>

									<h2>Dr. Anandhakumar P</h2>
									<p><b>Head, Department of Computer Science, Anna University</b></p>
									<blockquote>Venkat is one of the finest and all-round alumni to have graduated from our department. He graduated with a First Class and was in the top 5% of the graduating cohort of students from the University Department campuses of Anna University. I can certainly regard Venkat as one of my best students with a wide range of skillset.</blockquote>
